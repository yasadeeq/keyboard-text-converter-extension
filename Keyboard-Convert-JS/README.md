This keyboard converter is setup for hte Mac American-English QWERTY keyboard and the Mac Russian-Phonetic keyboard. It was developed out of a need to remedy the painstacking process of deleting and rewriting lines of text that were accidentally written in one keyboard rather than the other. When the user accidentally writes in Russian when s/he had thought that s/he was writing in English text, or vice versa, the user need only input the text and press the appropriate button to get the desired text result in the target language.
